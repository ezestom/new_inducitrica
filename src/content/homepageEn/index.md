    title: About Us
    img1: "/images/galery/1.webp"
    epigraph1: WE SOW THE FUTURE. We promote social and workplace inclusion. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title1: They make every harvest possible
    subtitle1: At Inducítrica, there is formal employment, children in schools, dignified work, and families that thrive. Because for us, the most valuable harvest is one of opportunities.
    description1_1: Behind every lemon, oil, juice, or peel that goes out into the world, there is a story born in Alberdi and its surroundings. Our presence in this city, located in the south of Tucumán, Argentina, drives local economies, strengthens the productive network, generates direct and indirect employment, promotes workplace inclusion with a gender perspective, and improves key indicators, such as school enrollment and family stability.
    description1_2: Here, work brings dignity and transformation. Young people who used to migrate now find real opportunities in their hometown. Meanwhile, new ventures, businesses, and services grow around this agro-industrial development. Because for us, the most valuable harvest is one of opportunities.

    epigraph2: ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. We use a tool that measures impact and improves the future. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title2: We measure our footprints
    subtitle2: What isn't measured can't be improved. Leading companies—like Inducítrica—now have their Life Cycle Assessment, with the goal of minimizing environmental impact.
    description2_1: In a world that increasingly demands environmental transparency, leading companies are stepping forward:they measure and make the real impacts of their production visible through a key tool, the Life Cycle Assessment (also known by its acronym, LCA).
    description2_2: It is a standardized international methodology that quantifies the environmental footprints of a product or process throughout its life cycle. This includes everything from the extraction of raw materials to final disposal, encompassing production, transportation, use, and recycling.
    description2_3: In the case of lemons and their agro-industrial products—such as juice, essential oil, or peel—an LCA considers the impact of cultivation (water, energy, fertilizers, etc.), industrial processing (energy consumption, waste, emissions, etc.), transportation, and even packaging use and its recyclability, among other issues.
    description2_4: The goal isn't just to measure; it's to understand and improve. To know where we stand in order to decide where we are going. Currently, companies that prioritize transparency with their clients and consumers, export to demanding markets with increasingly strict environmental regulations, and hold a real commitment to sustainability have a Life Cycle Assessment. Inducítrica is one of them.
    description2_5: Because we understand the magnitude of the environmental problem and the need to take action. This audit, conducted by external reviewers, has allowed us to identify critical points, reduce our carbon and other footprints, optimize resources, and, most importantly, make data-driven decisions. Ultimately, an LCA serves as a powerful statement.

    title3: We know how to do things right
    subtitle3: Our quality is no accident:it's the result of three decades of accumulated experience, passed down and applied to every decision in the harvest and industrial process.
    description3_1: Inducítrica is not just infrastructure, tonnage, industrial lemon products, and exports. It is also—and above all—applied knowledge. The difference between a good peel and an excellent one often lies in a detail that only an expert can detect. And we know.
    description3_2: Chemists, engineers, specialists, operators, supervisors... behind every fruit and every derivative product that goes out into the world, there is a team that deeply understands the behavior of the lemon in all its phases. That knowledge can't be improvised. It comes from years of working with the raw material, complying with regulatory requirements, and implementing continuous improvements.
    description3_3: In a market where everyone claims to offer quality, we have a more powerful differentiator:we know how to achieve it. And how to sustain it over time.

    img4: "/images/galery/1.webp"
    epigraph4: WE KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM. Our group doesn't just mass-produce:we work with identity. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title4: Inducítrica guarantees traceability
    subtitle4: Every lemon we process is registered, monitored, and traced from the moment it is harvested until it reaches the world as essential oil, juice, and dehydrated peel.
    description4_1: In a global market where trust is everything, Inducítrica positions itself as a company that guarantees complete traceability. This means every lemon we process can be tracked from its origin at the Frutucumán orchards to the end customer, whether in Europe, Asia, or America, and whether as fresh fruit or as lemon oil, lemon juice, and dehydrated peel.
    description4_2: We use integrated management systems. This allows us to record every batch, every treatment, and every transformation. Therefore, when we export lemon derivatives, we also export precise, validated, and transparent information. Our customers don't just buy quality:they buy food safety, regulatory compliance, and ethical production.
    description4_3: In a world that demands to know 'what we eat and how it's made,' we have the answers. And those answers are found in our systems. At Inducítrica, every lemon has an identity. Because every customer deserves to know exactly what they are buying.

    title: Origins
    img1: "/images/galery/1.webp"
    epigraph1: FROM THE BINS TO THE INDUSTRY. We work with our own lemons under a model of excellence. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title1: From Frutucumán, Inducítrica is born
    subtitle1: Frutucumán exports premium quality fresh fruit. Inducítrica processes lemons into essential oil, juice, and peel. A common origin. A unique model. A shared vision.
    description1_1: Inducítrica was born as the industrial unit of Frutucumán, Argentina's leading fresh fruit exporter. We produce essential oil, concentrated juice, and dehydrated lemon peel with raw material from our own fields, strategically located in the south of Tucumán—one of the world's best regions for citrus cultivation.
    description1_2: Our structure is comprised of four companies with over 30 years of track record:Blazquez SRL, Donato Álvarez SRL, Delotte SA, and Jalil SRL. This means that Frutucumán and Inducítrica form an integrated ecosystem for lemon production and processing. Both units work with their own lemons and under the same model for quality and quantity. Under the same model of environmental sustainability. Under the same model of corporate governance. And under the same model of commitment to regional development.
    description1_3: Therefore, Inducítrica and Frutucumán are more than just two brands; they are the result of our passion for lemons. Each product we offer is a reflection of the unwavering philosophy that drives us to the fields each morning. A common origin. A unique model. A shared vision.

    title2: Eight facts about us
    subtitle2: Our fresh fruit and our industrial products meet the highest standards for quality and quantity, because we work entirely with our own lemons.
    description2_1: At Inducítrica, quality isn't a goal:it's the starting point. It is born from the lemons we grow, grows with the experience of our founding companies, and is strengthened at every stage of the process. These eight facts explain how.
    description2_2: 1. Inducítrica was born as the industrial unit of Frutucumán, Argentina's leading fresh fruit exporter.
    description2_3: 2. At Inducítrica, we produce lemon oil, concentrated lemon juice, and dehydrated lemon peel.
    description2_4: 3. We are comprised of four companies with over 30 years of track record:Delotte SA, Blázquez SRL, Donato Álvarez SRL, and Jalil SRL.
    description2_5: 4. Our fields are strategically located in the south of the Argentine province of Tucumán, one of the best regions for citrus cultivation.
    description2_6: 5. Our fresh fruit and industrial products meet the highest quality standards. We guarantee complete traceability and ensure absolute control over every stage of the production process, precisely because we work with our own lemons.
    description2_7: 6. We are committed to addressing our environmental impact. We conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCA - ISO 14040/44) of our production.
    description2_8: 7. We also engage in other agricultural activities, including oranges, blueberries, sugarcane, soybeans, grains, and avocados.
    description2_9: 8. Our board of directors is composed of:Antonio Jalil (President), Ezequiel Almada (Vice President), and José Cebe (Director).

    epigraph3: ALWAYS PRESENT. We guarantee every link of the harvest and the lemon production process. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title3: We are the owners of the lemon
    subtitle3: From root to world, we have everything under control. Because Inducítrica is much more than a citrus company; it is a model of commitment to the lemon and its derivatives.
    description3_1: At Inducítrica, we don't delegate. We control every stage of the lemon's production process:from planting to the export of its essential oil, juice, and peel. This strategic decision allows us to guarantee what few others can:complete traceability, consistent quality, and products that maintain their purity.
    description3_2: We plant 1,800 hectares of lemons in the south of Tucumán, one of the most renowned regions on the planet for citrus cultivation. There, in our own fields, is where it all begins. With technology, knowledge, and respect for the environment, we cultivate a lemon that is born different.
    description3_3: That same lemon goes through a production circuit that is also our own:we harvest it, process it, and transform it into derivatives that travel to the most demanding international markets. This model of absolute integration is a guarantee. It means that a customer in North America, Europe, or Asia can know exactly which farm the lemon came from, or how and where it was processed. That's how we are at Inducítrica; different.

    epigraph4: AT THE FOREFRONT. The scale of our annual production positions us as a benchmark in the citrus industry. PHOTO:INDUCITRICA
    title4: Our packaging, our signature
    subtitle4: Each year, we process 35,000 tons of lemons for industrial use. This fruit, selected in our packing house, is transformed into oil, juice, and peel.
    description4_1: In our packing house, we apply the highest standards of hygiene, selection, and presentation. There, lemons destined for industrial use are carefully selected. This manual task allows us to guarantee the freshness, aroma, and flavor of the citrus fruits that will later be transformed into essential oil, juice, and dehydrated lemon peel.
    description4_2: This means that the fruit sent to the industry is not a discard; it is raw material chosen with the same rigor as any other. Each lemon is evaluated based on its potential to become a derivative, thus harnessing its fullest expression. Currently, we have 35,000 annual tons of our own lemons for the industry, with a projection of 60,000 to 70,000 annual tons by 2031.
    description4_3: Having our own packing house also means operational independence, agile timelines, and better product care. It means being present in every box... in every batch... in every shipment that carries our name. And that reaffirms our commitment to excellence.
