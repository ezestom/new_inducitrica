  paragraph1="Not all lemons are the same. And not all oils are the same. At Inducitrica, we are certain of both. Every drop of our oil carries the identity of fruit grown on our own land: 1,800 hectares in the south of Tucumán province, one of the best citrus-growing regions in the world. We don't outsource. We don't improvise. We don't speculate."
  paragraph2="Inducitrica is the natural evolution of Frutucumán, the leading business group in fresh fruit exports from Argentina. We are an industry that doesn't need to source raw materials, because we produce them ourselves. One that guarantees quality because we cultivate quantity. One that ensures traceability because we know the origin."
  paragraph3="We deliver what others only promise. Our lemon oil is extracted with state-of-the-art technology, under European standards, and with a profound respect for the environment. And we export it to the most demanding markets in the world, without losing the soul of the land where it was born."
  paragraph4="In short, our oil isn't just any oil. It's the best oil. It's the oil from the lemons we have been growing for over 30 years. With the same respect that we have always sown, we now transform."
