  paragraph1="Inducitrica was established as the industrial unit of Frutucumán, Argentina's leading fresh fruit exporter. We produce essential oil, concentrated juice, and dehydrated lemon peel using raw materials from our own farms, strategically located in southern Tucumán—one of the world's finest regions for citrus cultivation."
  paragraph2="Our structure is composed of four companies with over 30 years of experience: Blazquez SRL, Donato Álvarez SRL, Delotte SA, and Jalil SRL. Together, Frutucumán and Inducitrica form an integrated ecosystem for lemon production and processing. Both units operate with their own lemons and under the same model of quality and quantity. Under the same model of environmental sustainability. Under the same model of corporate governance. And under the same model of commitment to regional development."
  paragraph3="Therefore, Inducitrica and Frutucumán are more than just two brands; they are the result of our passion for lemons. Every product we offer is a reflection of the unwavering philosophy that drives us to the fields each morning. A common origin. A unique model. A shared vision."
