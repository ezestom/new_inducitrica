  title="We own the lemon"
  subtitle="Our business group integrates two strategic units: Frutucumán, the foundation, and Inducítrica, our second major vehicle—the one that industrializes lemon derivatives."

  epigraph1="WE HAVE THE SCALE. We currently have 35,000 tons of our own lemons available for industry each year. PHOTO: INDUCITRICA"
  paragraph1="At Inducitrica, we don't buy lemons—the lemons are ours. That’s why, to talk about Inducitrica, we must first talk about Frutucumán, Argentina's leading fresh fruit exporter."
  paragraph2="Thirty years ago, four family-owned companies—Jalil, Donato Álvarez, Delotte, and Blázquez—united their expertise to form Frutucumán. Today, our business group leads Argentina's fresh fruit exports, with 22,500 tons annually. Our main destinations include the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece, and Norway, among others."
  paragraph3="But we don't just set records for quantity, but also for quality. Because Frutucumán's trees grow with sun, water, and time. Nothing more. Nature does its part; we do the rest."
  paragraph4="We are located in the Argentine province of Tucumán, one of the best lands in the world for growing citrus. Across the 1,800 hectares farmed by Frutucumán, our lemons ripen free from frost and phytosanitary diseases. This has allowed us to cultivate both conventional and organic versions of our fruit."
  paragraph5="And we don't just export lemons. Frutucumán is also dedicated to producing and marketing export-quality blueberries and oranges. Every year, we send 20,000 pallets of lemons, 2,000 pallets of oranges, and 1,500 pallets of blueberries to the world."
  paragraph6="We hold international certifications such as GlobalG.A.P., GRASP, and HACCP, which are standards that guarantee food safety and quality. GlobalG.A.P. pertains to good agricultural practices, GRASP focuses on social practices towards workers, and HACCP centers on risk management in production."
  paragraph7={[
    "We have our own farms.",
    "We have our own lemons.",
    "We have our own packing facilities.",
    "And it is here that the story of Inducítrica begins to be written.",
    "Because the time has come to advance towards our own industry.",
  ]}
  paragraph8="Inducitrica is born from Frutucumán—the evolution of a tradition. Just as we are the leading exporters of fresh fruit from Argentina, we are the best producers of lemon oil, lemon juice, and dehydrated peel. We currently have 35,000 tons of our own lemons for industry annually, with a projection of 60,000 to 70,000 tons per year by 2031."
  paragraph9="Thus, Inducitrica is the natural consequence of a model that begins at the source: in the land, in the fruit, in decades of commitment."
  paragraph10="This is why we can say that what makes Inducitrica different is the lemon—*its* lemon. To supply the international market with lemon derivatives, it’s not enough to have a good product; you must have it consistently, in every batch. And that can only be achieved when the raw material is your own. For us, consistent quality is built upon having the scale to guarantee it."
  paragraph11="Another reason Inducitrica is different is our respect for the environment. Every decision we make is guided by a real commitment to our surroundings. To minimize our environmental impact, Frutucumán and Inducitrica have conducted a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), audited by external experts according to European regulations."
  paragraph12="With key indicators—such as our carbon footprint, water footprint, and resource depletion, among others—a rigorous and transparent approach to environmental management is guaranteed."
  paragraph13="Third, what makes Inducitrica different is the way we manage our company. We don't just want to grow; we want to do it right. We have a code of ethics, clear rules, auditable processes, a long-term vision, and sound business practices. In short, a robust compliance policy."
  paragraph14="Fourth, Inducitrica is set apart by the commitment to its people. Where there is one of our farms, there are formal-sector wages, children in schools, and open businesses. There are jobs that provide dignity, knowledge that is passed down, and pride that is inherited. For us, human capital is the heart of what we do."
  paragraph15="And fifth, what makes us different is our role as leaders in a regional economy that transcends borders. Because producing lemons is about planting a future. We are part of the economic, social, and cultural DNA of Tucumán. We produce at the source. We develop the territory. And we project ourselves to the world."
  paragraph16="We are ready to keep growing."
