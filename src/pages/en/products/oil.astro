  epigraph1="FROM TREE TO DRUM, ENTIRELY OURS. We don't just bottle oil; we bottle our history. A story that begins with the world's finest lemon. PHOTO: INDUCITRICA"
  paragraph1="At Inducitrica, our lemon oil is the result of a process that is meticulously managed from the very beginning. What sets us apart starts long before the industrial phase. It begins in the field—on our own 1,800 hectares in southern Tucumán, some of the world's most fertile land for growing citrus."
  paragraph2="We produce our oil with carefully selected lemons from the groves of Frutucumán, Argentina's number one fresh fruit exporter for over three decades. This means that from the moment they're picked, we guarantee aroma, freshness, and intensity. We guarantee quality and quantity. And we guarantee traceability, from the tree to the drum."
  paragraph3="In other words, we don't depend on third parties. The fruit is ours. As a result, every single batch of our oil is just as potent and consistent as the last."
  paragraph4="The oil is extracted using state-of-the-art technology. In parallel, we implement good agricultural practices and minimize our environmental impact."
  paragraph5="Ultimately, we don't just bottle oil; we bottle our history. A story that starts with the best lemon in the world and ends with a product that reaches the most demanding markets. We are the benchmark for Tucumán lemon oil."
