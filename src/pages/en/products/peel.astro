  paragraph1="At Inducitrica, nothing goes to waste. Every part of the lemon holds value, and we know how to unlock it. Our dehydrated peel is a fine ingredient, rich in bioactive compounds, natural aroma, and enormous potential."
  paragraph2="Our peel comes exclusively from our own lemons, grown on our 1,800 hectares in southern Tucumán, a region renowned worldwide for the quality of its citrus. Thanks to this complete vertical integration—from the tree to the final product—we guarantee a uniform, clean, and fully traceable ingredient."
  paragraph3="The dehydration process is carried out with state-of-the-art technology that keeps the fruit's properties intact. Furthermore, we operate with a strong environmental commitment and under the highest standards of good agricultural practices."
  paragraph4="At Inducitrica, we transform what others discard into value. Because when everything begins with quality, everything has a purpose."
