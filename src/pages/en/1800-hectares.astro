  paragraph1="We grow our lemons in and around the town of Alberdi, in the southern part of Tucumán province, Argentina. This region offers exceptional agro-ecological conditions for citrus: deep, fertile soils, well-distributed rainfall, high sun exposure, and a significant daily temperature range."
  paragraph2="Thanks to this environment, our lemons develop their full potential: firm skin, abundant juice, balanced acidity, and aromatic intensity. Additionally, the altitude and geographical location promote a gradual and healthy ripening process."
  paragraph3="Furthermore, the proximity between our farms and our industrial facility allows for an efficient harvest and immediate processing, which further preserves freshness. Our business group—comprising Jalil, Donato Alvarez, Delotte, and Blázquez—owns approximately 1,800 hectares dedicated to citrus in this area."
  paragraph4="Every hectare is managed with sustainable agricultural practices. We preserve the native foothills, optimize water use with our own reservoir, and measure our environmental footprint. In short, we produce in a natural paradise, with an environmental commitment, deep local roots, and a global vision."
